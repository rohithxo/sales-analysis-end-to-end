## 🗄 Database & SQL Business Analysis

The cleaned dataset was structured in MySQL and analyzed to solve real-world business questions.

### 📊 Business Questions Solved

1. **Gender-Based Revenue Analysis**  
   - What is the total revenue generated by male vs. female customers?

   - Which 5 products have the highest average customer review rating?

4. **Shipping Type Comparison**  
   - How does average purchase value differ between Standard and Express shipping?

5. **Subscription Revenue Impact**  
   - Do subscribed customers spend more?  
   - Comparison of average purchase amount and total revenue between subscribers and non-subscribers.

6. **Discount Utilization Analysis**  
   - Which 5 products have the highest percentage of purchases with discounts applied?

7. **Customer Segmentation**  
   - Segmented customers into:
     - New
     - Returning
     - Loyal  
   - Based on previous purchase count.

8. **Product Popularity Within Categories**  
   - Identified the top 3 most purchased products within each category.

9. **Repeat Buyer Subscription Behavior**
